# Password Generator
## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a working random password generator through the use of JavaScript. When loaded, the user should be met with a page containing a password generator. When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user will be met with various prompts asking the type of characters they would like to include in their password. Once all prompts have been answered, the user will have a random password generated inside the dotted box made up of all the characters they selected.
